# BioHashing for similarity Search
Example of "biological" learning for MNIST based on the paper [Unsupervised Learning by Competing Hidden Units](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1820458116) by D.Krotov and J.Hopfield. If you want to learn more about this work you can also check out this [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lY-oAY0aQU) from MIT's [6.S191 course](http://introtodeeplearning.com/).  

## Getting started
This contains original and modified codes for Unsupervised similarity search using Biohashing, a novel Locality Sensitive Hashing technique where the hash function is a set of synapses of dimension higher than the output with Hebbian-like weight updation rule, a development over FlyHash. We tried to recognise similar numbers from MNIST data set.
